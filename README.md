## Note & Disclaimer

This is a fork that I was doing to basically replace the `exif_read_data()` call with `wp_read_image_metadata()`, which includes metadata from IPTC, not only EXIF. Unfortunately, for security reasons, the Automattic folks clean up the results, stripping all the tags from them, including non-HTML tags, which _may_ render the information next to useless. See [issue #14](https://github.com/creativecommons/wp-plugin-creativecommons/issues/14).

A pity that I only read that 5-year-old issue _after_ doing all the work on this fork, which _also_ includes a lot of cleaning up. Alas, everything now is useless, so I'm freezing the code and archiving it on GitHub, in case anyone finds the subtle changes I made to get the code more conforming to the WordPress coding style useful...

## Description

The plugin is an attribution tool. It has multiple features that allow users to
attribute their content by including Creative Commons license ([Choose a
License](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)) on their WordPress website. This
includes default, post, page and media attribution.


## Installation

Download the latest version from this project's [releases][releases]. You can
install the plugin to your WP website using any of these methods:

[releases]: https://github.com/creativecommons/creativecommons-wordpress-plugin/releases "Releases Â· creativecommons/creativecommons-wordpress-plugin"

1. In your plugin Dashboard on WordPress, Click **Add New** and upload the
   plugin `.zip` file. When installed, activate the plugin.
2. Extract the `.zip` file and paste the extracted folder to the
   "/wp-content/plugins/" directory. Go to your plugin Dashboard and activate
   the plugin.


## Features


### Setting a Default Site License

After activating the plugin, head to **Settings > Creative Commons** to set up
the default license.

![Plugin Settings](https://cl.ly/01ae314c5c57/img)

Selecting a license is simple. Select one from the given CC licenses, by
default [**CC BY-SA**](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license
is used.

![Select License](https://cl.ly/bfd84b912c78/img)

There are multiple options available for the license. You
can add:

- Additional attribution text for a custom note.
- Title and Title URL. If not mentioned it defaults to "the content".
- Author and Author URL. If not mentioned it defaults to "on this site".
- Display options.

![License Options](https://cl.ly/b4520d6ab6b1/img)


### Widget

There are two options to display the default license, as a widget or in the
footer. We recommend using the widget for better theme compatibility.

![Widget](https://cl.ly/2dacc1739955/img)

After selecting the widget go to **Appearance > Widgets** and drag the CC
License Widget to the required area. The widget will then display the default
license on all pages of the site.

### Gutenberg Blocks

The plugin adds specific Gutenberg blocks for each Creative Commons license. If
you are using the default Gutenberg editor, you will find these blocks under a
separate category.

![Blocks Category](https://cl.ly/4934cdc59cd4/img)

These blocks can be used to license any page/post/image or other media.

- Display license for the site, posts and pages
  license)
- License your WordPress Network (WordPress Multisite install)
- License some of your sites differently in your WordPress Network
- License some posts, pages, or images differently from your default license
  (per content license)
- License posts and pages by simply including CC Gutenberg blocks for each
  license required (Gutenberg License Blocks)

## History

This plugin is loosely based on an existing, but seemingly abandoned WordPress
plugin named 'License' (a component of the [MIT Educational Collaboration
Space][collabspace] project) by mitcho (Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine) and Brett
Mellor. We're also inspired by Creative Commons' original
[wordpress-cc-plugin][oldplugin] written by former Creative Commons CTO Nathan
Yergler.
